# This vignette's goal

After showing how to use `nn2poly` in its default version in `vignette("nn2poly-01-introduction")`, here we will present how to use specific methods related to `torch` (and its high level interface for R `luz`) that allow for an easier and smoother use of `nn2poly` with that deep learning framework. Furthermore, we will show how to impose the needed weight constraints in `torch` during training to have accurate results and compare those results with an unconstrained neural network.

In this vignette we will focus on a simple regression example. A classification example is covered in `vignette("nn2poly-03-tensorflow-classification")`.
