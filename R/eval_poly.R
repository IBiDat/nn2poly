#' Polynomial evaluation
#'
#' Evaluates one or several polynomials on the given data.
#'
#' Note that this function is unstable and subject to change. Therefore it is
#' not exported but this documentations is left available so users can use it if
#' needed to simulate data by using \code{nn2poly:::eval_poly()}
#'
#' @param poly List containing 2 items: \code{labels} and \code{values}.
#' - \code{labels}: List of integer vectors with same length (or number of cols)
#' as \code{values}, where each integer vector denotes the combination of
#' variables associated to the coefficient value stored at the same position in
#' \code{values}. That is, the monomials in the polynomial. Note that the
#' variables are numbered from 1 to p, with the intercept is represented by 0.
#' - \code{values}: Matrix (can also be a vector if single polynomial), where
#' each column represents a polynomial, with same number of rows as the length
#' of \code{labels}, containing at each row the value of the coefficient
#' of the monomial given by the equivalent label in that same position.
#'
#' Example: If \code{labels} contains the integer vector c(1,1,3) at position
#' 5, then the value stored in \code{values} at row 5 is the coefficient
#' associated with the term x_1^2*x_3.
#'
#' @param newdata Input data as matrix, vector or dataframe.
#' Number of columns (or elements in vector) should be the number of variables
#' in the polynomial (dimension p). Response variable to be predicted should
#' not be included.
#'
#' @return Returns a matrix containing the evaluation of the polynomials.
#' Each column corresponds to each polynomial used and each row to each
#' observation, meaning that each column vector corresponds to the results of
#' evaluating all the given data for each polynomial.
#'
#' @seealso \code{eval_poly()} is also used in [predict.nn2poly()].
