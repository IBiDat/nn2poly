# nn2poly: Transforming Neural Networks into Polynomials

The **nn2poly** package implements the NN2Poly method that allows to
transform an already trained deep feed-forward fully connected neural
network into a polynomial representation that predicts as similar as
possible to the original neural network. The obtained polynomial
coefficients can be used to explain features (and their interactions)
importance in the neural network, therefore working as a tool for
interpretability or eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).
